## :heart: 2 minutes quick start

## :computer: Running the server

:bulb: Run the server on the command line just typing the following command:
```
php artisan serve
```
After that it will show at the terminal something like that:
```
Starting Laravel development server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
[Sat Feb 13 01:48:26 2021] PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://127.0.0.1:8000) started
```

Now you can the link on the browser and you will see the application running! 
I used the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox to simulate this conversation
